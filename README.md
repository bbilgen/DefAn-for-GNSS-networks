# DefAn-for-GNSS-networks
DefAnforGNSS is a new scientific software encoded in R programming language for carrying out geodetic deformation analysis in GNSS networks using Bernese v5.2-based output files. The software determines absolute deformations in the GNSS network established for detecting deformations on engineering structures and earth's crust, illustrates input data and output results, and provides results as reports in two different formats HTML and PDF. 

The software requires the R package and RStudio editor, and runs on RStudio Desktop v1.4 or newer versions.


DefAn-for-GNSS-networks folder:
  * 'DefAnforGNSS.R' (download, and open this file on your RStudio Desktop)
  * 'Reporting.Rmd' (R markdown file for reporting the analysis results)
  * 'DefAnforGNSS.Rproj' (R project file to automatically open RStudio Desktop)
  * User Guide (instructions to use software)


Sample data folder: 
  * contains sample input data files for users to test the application 


Sample output results folder: 
  * contains sample output reports in HTML and PDF formats
